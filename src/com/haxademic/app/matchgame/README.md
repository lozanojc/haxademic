Running the Match Game
-----------------------------------------------

* Make sure the machine is set to 1024 x 768
	* Open System Preferences
	* Click Displays
	* Set "Resolution" to "Scaled" and click 1024x768
	* When plugged into a projector, make sure to "mirror" the displays at this resolution
* Make sure the Kinect is plugged into a USB port on the computer and plugged into a power outlet
* Start Eclipse from the Mac Dock
* If you've pulled updated code, make sure to follow the update instructions below
* Launch the Menu Bar Tint application from the Mac Dock
* Find the larger green "play" button in the top bar in Eclipse, and click the tiny "down arrow" to the right
* Select "MatchGame" and the game will launch
* If any errors pop up, make sure to press "Ignore" on any error popups, and (force) quit the game as described below
	* I've had to unplug and replug the Kinect USB once when I kept getting errors on launch, but this shouldn't happen



Quitting the game
-----------------------------------------------

* Kill the Menu Bar Tint application by clicking it again from the Dock and click the "Quit" button on the screen that pops up
* To quit the game, press the ESC key on your keyboard
	* If that doesn't work, you can select "Quit" from your norman application menu bar at the top of the screen
* To force-quit the game, you can also Command-Tab over to Eclipse, and press the small square red button in the Console window towards the bottom of the screen 



Updating the game with new code
-----------------------------------------------

* Open GitHub from the Mac Dock
* GitHub should already be on the Haxademic project page
* In GitHub, click "Repository" -> "Pull" from the app menu bar at the top of the screen
* Close GitHub
* Open Eclipse from the Mac Dock
* In Eclipse, click "File" -> "Refresh" from the app menu bar
