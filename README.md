# Haxademic
Haxademic is a multimedia platform, built in Java and [Processing](http://processing.org/). is a starting point for interactive visuals, giving you a unified environment for both realtime and rendering modes. It loads several Java libraries and wraps them up to play nicely with each other, all within the context of Haxademic. It handles any number of problems faced by thread-unsafe inputs like MIDI.

## Pre-Alpha State
While the code has been open-sourced, this library is definitely not ready for general use, but I'm trying to get it there. If you're interested in collaborating, please contact me via my [GitHub account](http://github.com/cacheflowe), or my [web site](http://cacheflowe.com/?page=contact). If you're interested in getting the project running, let me know and I can help for now.
