# Haxademic
Haxademic is a multimedia platform, built in Java and [Processing](http://processing.org/). Its primary use is for realtime and rendered audio-reactive visuals, with support for a variety of hardware inputs, like audio, MIDI, Kinect and Launchpad. It handles any number of problems faced by thread-unsafe input from these inputs, and has a growing library of utility code to accomplish common visual calculations.

## Pre-Alpha State
While the code has been open-sourced, this library is definitely not ready for general use, but I'm trying to get it there. If you're interested in collaborating, please contact me via my [GitHub account](http://github.com/cacheflowe), or my [web site](http://cacheflowe.com/?page=contact). If you're interested in getting the project running, let me know and I can help for now.
